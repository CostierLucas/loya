## Short Description
Loya is a loyalty-rewards dApp that helps small businesses reward and build stronger relationships with their best customers. Built on Optimism, Base, Zora and The Graph, Loya acts as a rewards layer between customers and merchants that can be used without any prior experience with crypto.

## About Loya 
Loya can be used on any device and allows merchants to create and manage peer-to-peer loyalty reward programs. Customers join loyalty programs by simply scanning a QR code and sign into the app with any Web2 login or EVM-compatible wallet. Through Loyaâ€™s dApp interface, users can track their rewards,  participate in different programs, and earn badges and coupons that can be redeemed for rewards. 

## What we set out to accomplish?

While many forms of traditional loyalty point systems exist, modern solutions are often cost-prohibitive or too complex for smaller merchants to implement, require a third-party intermediary and force customers to create profiles while handing over their personal data. We believe that Loya offers a better solution for both customers and merchants by acting as a peer-to-peer rewards layer.

- **Democratize loyalty points**
    - Loya can be set up and used by anyone on any device. By leveraging the Optimism Stack businesses can use Loya without any recurring subscription or maintenance fees
- **Enhance customer experiences**
    - Loya offers customers a transparent and secure way to redeem and earn rewards while helping merchants build stronger relationships with their best customers
- **Preserve customer privacy**
    - Loya allows users to choose what personal data is shared through their profile while removing the need for small businesses or intermediaries to handle and maintain customer data
- **Make it easy and fun**!
    - Loya makes it seamless for customers and vendors to leverage the benefits of Web3 without any prior experience with crypto.
